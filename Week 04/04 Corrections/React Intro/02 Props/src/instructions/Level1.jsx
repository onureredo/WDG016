          A component called <b>Header</b> is created for you already. Have a
          look at the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          First, you need to pass a prop named
          <span className='highlight'>title</span> containing the value
          <span className='highlight'>React is amazing!</span> to the
          <b>Header</b> component.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now in your <b>Header</b> component, extract the title props you
          passed in the previous step and display it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};

export default Level1;
