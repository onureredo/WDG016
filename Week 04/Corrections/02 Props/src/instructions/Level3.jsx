          This time, you get to display whatever you like in the component.

          Back in the <b>App</b> component, create a function that logs{' '}
          <span className='highlight'>Piece of cake</span> to the console.
        </li>
        <li>Pass this function as props to your new component.</li>
        <li>
          In your new component, extract the function and call it within the new
          component.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check your console. If you see{' '}

          console, you have made it! 🥳
