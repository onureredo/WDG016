          Its time for the secret santa of the year. In
          <b>SecretSantaChat.js</b>, you have a variable for the gift you would
          like to receive from your secret santa. Replace the string with the
          type of gift you wouldd like to receive.

          You have a ready component for you to display messages in the chat,

          Your secret santa will give you a random gift back, from the
          <i>secretSantaGift</i> function. What could it be? Render a new
          message that says:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>I have received a -your chosen gift-, just what I wanted!</i>
              if your gift is what you asked for.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>I got a -item received-</i> if you were gifted something else.
